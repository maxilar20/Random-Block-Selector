# Random-Block-Selector

A python program that allows you to better randomize the placing of blocks. 
One example is to create gradients.

Currently working on creating a portable version so you don't have to install python.

# Usage
The randomizer works by clicking a random number which selects a block in your toolbar. It then changes to a new random one after right clicking.

For the setup you need to choose a length of gradient, the distribution of blocks for each length. You can insert the name of the blocks to help you visualize which blocks will be used. To setup gradient steps you can click on the predetermined positions and change it's concentrations. 

You can add more steps by clicking on an empty spot on the first bar, and remove by right clicking on an existing step.

After setting up your desired gradients simply press ctrl+shift+a to start the block randomizer. If you created a gradient you can press ctrl + plus to increase or ctrl + minus to decrease the position on the gradient.
